## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned how to use the clamp() function to make typography responsive.
Here is an example:

```html
 <h1>Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
```
```css
h1 {
    font-size: clamp(1.1rem, 1.0429rem + 0.2857vw, 1.5rem);
}
```

### Useful resources
